        <p>I have been working with Donald now consistently for over 15 years. During this time I have gone though such a great metamorphose that I feel like I can now say I feel love and joy pretty much most of the time and I have created a really wonderful life for myself. I teach yoga, offer sessions in this work, make films and travel the world all while being a mama. Donald has been my guide & my friend and helped me through the darkest days of my spiritual journey and taught me how to embrace it all. He is a pioneer, a trailblazer, a risk taker and the brightest channel of light I have ever had the privilege of meeting. To work with him is to enter into an entirely new vibration of light.</p>

        <p>Donald reconnected me with the divine within. His gift of bringing through the unconditional love necessary to melt away the emotional, mental and physical blocks to our divine self is beyond works. Experiencing his work helped me remember what I came to do. He is Unconditional Love.</p>
